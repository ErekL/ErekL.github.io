	<h3> Directions </h3>
	   <ol>
	      <li> In a medium bowl, whisk together the baking powder, salt and 2 1⁄2 cups of the flour. </li>
	      <li> Using an electric mixer, beat the butter and sugar in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Add the egg and vanilla, and beat to combine. With the mixer on low, gradually add the flour mixture, mixing just until incorporated. </li>
	      <li>Transfer half the dough (about 1 1/2 cups) to a bowl; set aside. Add the chocolate and remaining 1 1/2 Tbsp flour to remaining dough and mix to combine. Between 2 sheets of wax paper (you'll need 4 total), roll each portion of dough (chocolate and vanilla) into a 1/2-in.-thick, 11 x 4-in. rectangle. Refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes. </li>
	      <li> Remove top sheets of wax paper from dough and brush top of vanilla rectangle with egg white. Place the chocolate rectangle on top; press gently to help it adhere. Cut 1/2-in.-thick strips of the dough. Working with 2 strips of dough at a time (a strip is comprised of the vanilla adhered to the chocolate, so you need 2 of those), brush the cut side of one with egg white and gently press it onto the other, alternating the vanilla and chocolate doughs to form a checkerboard-patterned log. Wrap in plastic wrap. </li>
	      <li> Heat oven to 350°F. Line several baking sheets with parchment paper. Cut the logs into 1/8-in.-thick slices and transfer to the prepared baking sheets, spacing them 1 in. apart. Bake until just set and golden around the edges, 8 to 10 minutes. Immediately transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool completely. </li>
